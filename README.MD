##  Project Components

### 1.  Database Design
- Created a full **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** and **Database Diagram**.
- Performed **data mapping** and **data population**.
- Designed the database using **SQL Server**.
- Built multiple **Stored Procedures**, including **4 core ones** for:
  - Random question generation.  
  - Managing exam sessions.  
  - Storing student answers.  
  - Displaying and evaluating results.

### 2.  SSRS Reports
Developed **6 detailed SSRS reports** to visualize:
- Student information and performance.
- Exams and their structures.
- Students’ answers and results.
- Instructor performance and course analytics.

### 3.  Web Applications
####  Streamlit Exam Website
- Allows students to log in using **email and password**.
- Generates exams dynamically.
- Records answers and displays feedback.

####  Power Apps Website
- Built an alternative version where students log in using their **Student ID**.
- Connected to the same SQL database for real-time updates.

### 4.  Power BI Dashboard
- Designed an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** to analyze exam and student data.
- Used **SQL Views** for data connection.
- Implemented a **Star Schema Data Model** that includes a **Bridge Table** to manage **many-to-many relationships** between dimensions.
